SynUtil
=======

SynUtil is a lightweight command-line utility for communicating with SY7xx terminals.
It has an embedded copy of the [Syndll2](https://github.com/synel/syndll2) library,
which is used for all communications with the terminal.

Many commands are available.  Run `synutil.exe` without any parameters to get help.

Only *some* of the functionality offered by Syndll2 is currently implemented in SynUtil.
Additional commands will be added in a future release.  If you need a specific command that
does not exist, please [open an issue here to request it](https://github.com/synel/SynUtil/issues).
